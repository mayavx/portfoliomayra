            <p>During the design course, we had to create a menu for a cocktail bar. Each of us in the class was assigned a different designer, and we had to incorporate the style of this designer into our final product. My assigned designer was Mieke Gerritsen. I started my research into Mieke's work, and I immediately noticed that she uses a lot of capital letters and a lot of color. Her work also consists of thick lines and repeating shapes.</p>
            <p>At first, I struggled to design a good menu card because her style is naturally very busy. The question for myself was 'how do I design this in a way that it's not too busy for the user'. I started playing with colors. Each color had to complement each other but still be slightly different.</p>
