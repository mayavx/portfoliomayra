            <p>During this team project, we created a physical fashion magazine with the aim of informing readers about fast fashion. With our magazine, we wanted to encourage people to buy less fast fashion because it's very harmful to the environment. All the production in factories and the disposal/burning of clothing is very detrimental to the surroundings.</p>
            <p>While creating our magazine, we considered our target audience. Our magazine had to fit the target audience. Our target audience was people between the ages of 15 and 25 because we noticed that people in these age groups often buy a lot of fast fashion. The pages of the magazine's content, located at the bottom of the page, were designed by me.</p>
