        <p>This was my first team project. I always enjoy working together because everyone brings different ideas to the project. By discussing together, we ensure that we deliver a good final product. I noticed that within my group, I took on a leadership role. I made sure that everyone completed their tasks because I really don't like falling behind. Everything needs to be done on time, and sometimes you have to motivate your teammates to keep working so that everyone contributes.</p>
        <p>With this project, we created an interactive 'app' in Figma. The goal was to make a recipe app for a recipe assigned to us as a group. We were given the recipe for Mexican Tostada, so we gave our app a Mexican atmosphere and added a few other Mexican recipes. All the images are original content.</p>
        <p>Initially, we made some sketches. Sketching gives you a visual idea of what we actually want to do with our recipe app. We had many great ideas that we wanted to include in the app, but of course, we also had to consider the deadline and whether it was all feasible.</p>
