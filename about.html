        <p>Hi, my name is Mayra and I am 18 years old. I am a first-year student at the Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences, studying Communication and Multimedia Design (CMD). I chose this course because my passion has always been in designing and coding. This course is the perfect blend of my interests.</p>
        <p>During the first year of the CMD program, I have developed my skills extensively in designing. Every design involves a pre-design process that demonstrates the steps taken before the final product could be presented. Initially, I didn't know how to design, but now I realize that without a design process, a design cannot come into existence. I find it most enjoyable to keep track of the design process because it allows for continual experimentation and iteration with new ideas. It also involves looking at design aspects and how to optimize the usability of your product for the end user. I am open to constantly learning new things and improving my skills in my field.</p>
