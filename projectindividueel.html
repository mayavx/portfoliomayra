            <p>In this individual project, I was tasked with creating a sustainable website. This website not only had to be sustainable but also focus on a sustainable place in Amsterdam. I chose thrift shops in Amsterdam because thrifting is an environmentally friendly way of shopping for clothes.</p>
            <p>We had just completed the programming course, so I only knew the basics of HTML and CSS. The website had to be designed for an iPhone. I found it quite challenging to create a website for the size of an iPhone because you had to consider many things, such as font size, how to display navigation, and where to place images. My website only looks good if you click on 'inspect' and set it to iPhone size.</p>
